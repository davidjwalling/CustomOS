### Project os.002
Source: [os.002/os.asm](../os.002/os.asm)
### Features and Topics
- BIOS Diskette Read and Write Sectors
- FAT-12 and Diskette Directory Structure
### Source-Code Notes
- The program introduces the BUILDCOM directive to create the OS kernel program, os.com.
- The diskette image file os.dsk is expanded to include the standard two copies of the file allocation table (FAT), the diskette directory and the os.com program.
- The boot sector is expanded to search the diskette directory to find, load and run os.com.
### [Virtual](VIRTUAL.md) Machine Operation
- Start a VirtualBox VM configured to boot from os.dsk, emulating a 3.5" 1.44MB floppy diskette following these [steps](VIRTUAL.md).
- The boot (first) sector of the diskette image is loaded to real mode address 0x7C00 and executed.
- The boot sector displays a message, "Loading OS".
- The boot sector then searches the diskette, or image file, for the os.com program.
- If os.com is not found, an error messages is displayed.
- If os.com is found, it is loaded into memory and control is passed to it.
- The os.com program displays a message, "Starting OS".
- Upon a key press, the system restarts.

### [Physical](PHYSICAL.md) Machine Operation
- Prepare a physical 3.5" 1.44 MB diskette with os.002/os.dat as the boot sector following these [steps](PHYSICAL.md).
- Note: Copy os.002/os.dat to the diskette boot sector instead of os.001/os.dat.
- Copy os.002/os.com onto the physical diskette.
- Insert the prepared diskette into a 3.5" floppy disk drive configured as Drive A:.
- Start the system.

In the next project, we will add the osprep.com program to assist in updating floppy diskette boot sectors.
