### Notes

- This project significantly expands the OS loader program, <span>os.com</span>.
- The CPU type is checked to ensure 32-bit Protected Mode operational support (Intel 80386+).
- OS reserved memory areas are mapped to low memory addresses.
- Entry points are defined for CPU, hardware and software interrupts.
- A 32-bit protected mode task is called by the OS loader.
- The "console" task initializes system storage and draws the initial "panel".
- The console task enters a wait loop until the system is stopped.

This project introduces code that interfaces with several devices, the 6845 cathode ray tube (CRT) controller, the NEC 765 floppy disk controller (FDC), the 8042 kKeyboard controller, the 8259 peripheral interrupt controller (PIC) and the 8253 programmable interrupt timer (PIT).

This project places the processor into Protected Mode. In this mode, segments are defined in descriptor tables. For each table entry, an access flags word describes the nature of segment (code, data, interrupt, trap, task, gate, etc.).

To enter protected mode, this program uses BIOS interrupt 89h, function 15h. We also expand the ASCII code definition table.

The main protected mode task that drives the OS is the Console Task. We define several constats to define the size and dimensions of the console screen. To reference code and data segments in the global descriptor table, we define symbolic constants for these table entry offsets. 

<img src="../images/os004_listing_309.PNG"/>

The OS will reference a few predefined low memory addresses that are set by the BIOS. Here we define a structure that maps the BIOS data area.

The Console Task presents information using sets of character fields called panels. Panel fields have a row and column location, a buffer to hold content, attribute and variables tracking the offset of the current input location and which part, if any, of the content is in a selected state.

In the kernel variables section, which is mapped to follow the BIOS working storage area, we also track the current cursor position.

The mint, mtrap, menter and tsvce macros assist in building tables and entry points for interrupts.

The size of the OS loader program, <span>os.com</span>, which now includes the OS kernel image itself, is now significantly larger than in project os.003. Here we update the FAT tables to indicate the size and location on disk of the loader program.

Since the OS will run in protected mode and use instructions introduced with the 80386 processor, we add code to the loader to check the CPU type. If the CPU type passes, the global descriptor table (GDT) is updated so that the current code segment of the loader is properly defined. This will allow us to perform a long JMP to a task state segment (TSS) without generating an exception.

Now the OS kernel image, global and interrupt descriptor tables, interrupt handlers and the Console Task is now relocated to its desired location in memory, immediately following OS working storage. The CPU is placed in protected mode, system interrupts are enabled and a long JMP to the Console Task State Segment is made to make the Console Task the currently running task.

If the OS could not be successfully started, the loader exit displays the appropriate error message, waits for the operator to press a key and restarts the system.

For this project, determing the CPU simply checks that the processor is at least an 800386.

The OS loader data segment defines some work areas and message constants.

The OS kernel begins here, consisting of the Global Descriptor Table (GDT), the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT), Interrupt Handlers and the Console Task.

<img src="../images/os004_listing_1340.PNG"/>

The Global Descriptor Table (GDT) defines the location, size and attributes of memory locations that may be accessed by any task.

<img src="../images/os004_listing_1396.PNG"/>

The Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) defines the location and type of interrupt handling routines for processor, hardware and software interrupts and traps. The mint, mtrap macros assist in defining these descriptor entries.

Interrupt handling code begins here and will be developed over the course of several subprojects.
